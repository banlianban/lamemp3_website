  "FAQ": {
    "title": "FAQ",
    "list": [
      { "q": "Why does my car say 'Read Error' or skip songs?", "a": "Likely due to VBR bitrate or large cover art (>1MB). Our tool fixes this." },
      { "q": "Will audio quality degrade?", "a": "We use LAME, the best MP3 encoder, with up to 320kbps CBR, ensuring highest quality and compatibility." },
      { "q": "Do you support batch conversion?", "a": "Yes, you can upload a whole folder." },
      { "q": "Why CBR instead of VBR?", "a": "While VBR offers better quality and smaller file sizes, many legacy car systems can't parse VBR correctly, causing progress bar issues or playback skips. CBR ensures maximum compatibility." },
      { "q": "Will converted files play on all car systems?", "a": "Our tool generates MP3 files following the strictest standards, compatible with 99% of car audio systems, including most factory and aftermarket units from 2000 onwards." },
      { "q": "Do you store my uploaded files?", "a": "No. All files are processed locally in your browser and not uploaded to any server. Temporary files are automatically deleted after processing, ensuring complete privacy." }
